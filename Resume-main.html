            <p>Hello and thank you for taking the time to view my resume.
                I will be graduating in December with my bachelorâ€™s degree in Applied Computer Science. 
                I have grown to love programing and coding and often read up or test programs in my spare time. 
                I am currently working on furthering my knowledge in Java, JavaScript, and Node.js. </p>
            <p>Below are links to some practical skills and experiences I have picked up over the years, 
                my previous work experiences, and a few programs and codes that I have worked on in both my schooling and my personal time.</p>
